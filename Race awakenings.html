        The Race Awakening (also known as Race V4) was added on January 6, 2023, as a way to level up players' race even further. It is only obtainable in the Third Sea.
The Race Awakening grants the player access to new skills and abilities and requires the completion of specific quests, puzzles, and trials, depending on the Race.
Each race awakening provides the user with abilities that enhance their mobility, reduce their cooldown, fortify their defense, and aid in PvP and PvE combat, among other perks.
